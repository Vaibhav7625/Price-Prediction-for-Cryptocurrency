# Price Prediction for Cryptocurrency ðŸ“ˆ

Welcome to the "Price Prediction for Cryptocurrency" project! This repository showcases our efforts to forecast cryptocurrency prices using time series machine learning models.

## Project Overview

This project was developed by Vaibhav Gupta, Navya Sharma, and Anshul Kannaujia. We aimed to predict the prices of three major cryptocurrenciesâ€”Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solanaâ€”using advanced time series forecasting techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset was sourced from the `yfinance` package in Python, focusing on the closing values of each cryptocurrency. We used:

- **Training Data:** All historical data except the last year.
- **Testing Data:** Data from the last year.

## Feature Used

We used the closing value of each cryptocurrency as our primary feature for modeling.

## Models

### 1. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

ARIMA is a widely-used time series forecasting method that combines autoregressive (AR) terms, differencing (I), and moving average (MA) terms to model a time series.

- **Stationarity Check:** We initially checked the stationarity of the data using Rolling Mean, Rolling Standard Deviation, and the Dickey-Fuller (DF) test. The data was found to be non-stationary.
- **Transformation:** We applied a logarithmic transformation to stabilize the variance, making the data somewhat stationary.
- **Differencing:** We performed differencing to get the value of `d` required for the ARIMA model.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** For determining the values of `p` and `q`, we used PACF (Partial AutoCorrelation Function) and ACF (AutoCorrelation Function) plots. The `pmdarima` package was used for fine-tuning all parameters (`p`, `d`, and `q`).
- **Trend, Seasonality, and Residuals:** We plotted trend, seasonality, and residuals to gain a better understanding of the data.
- **Forecasting:** After training the ARIMA model, we forecasted values for the testing data and evaluated the performance using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and RÂ² (R-squared).

### 2. Prophet

- **Overview:** Prophet is a forecasting tool developed by Facebook that is designed to handle seasonal effects and holidays.
- **Implementation:** We configured Prophet to capture trends and seasonality in the cryptocurrency prices.

### 3. Neural Prophet

- **Overview:** Neural Prophet extends the Prophet model by incorporating neural network components to capture complex patterns.
- **Implementation:** Neural Prophet was applied to predict future values, and its performance was compared with the other models.

## Results

We calculated RMSE and RÂ² for each model. Due to the high volatility of cryptocurrency prices, none of the models performed exceptionally well. However, ARIMA yielded the best results among the three.

## Web Application

We developed a simple web application using the Streamlit package to provide an interactive interface for users:

- **Selection:** Users can select a cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana) using a dropdown menu.
- **Model Explanation:** For the selected cryptocurrency, the application explains the dataset, the ARIMA approach, and the results.
- **Results:** The web app showcases the performance of the ARIMA model, including the forecasted values and evaluation metrics.

## Power BI Dashboard

We created a Power BI dashboard to visually represent the data and model predictions. The dashboard includes:

- Various charts to illustrate trends and forecasts.
- Visualization of forecasted values using Power BI's built-in forecasting features.

## Repository Contents

This GitHub repository includes:

- **Web App Code:** Source code for the Streamlit application.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Implementation of ARIMA, Prophet, and Neural Prophet models for each cryptocurrency.
- **Power BI Dashboard File:** The `.pbix` file for the Power BI dashboard.
- **Project Report:** Our detailed project report is provided in both PDF and Word formats.
- **Datasets:** CSV files for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL).
